							<h3>The lab</h3>

<p>
Language is a complex mental faculty, recruiting and integrating several interacting representational and computational architectures in the mind. At the Language, Mind and Brain Lab (LaMB Lab), we investigate the nature of the cognitive and neural architecture that supports the human language system and how it interfaces with other cognitive faculties. We combine insights from linguistic theory, processing models and what is known about their neurobiological underpinnings in order to guide our research questions.
</p>
						<h3>The core questions</h3>
<p>
						<ol>
							<li>What is the nature of linguistic representations?</i>
							<li>How are these representations recruited and deployed in real-time language comprehension and production?</i>
							<li>What is the neural architecture underlying these representations and computational processes?</i>
						</ol>
</p>

						<h3>The research methods</h3>

<p>
The lab houses several behavioral testing stations, as well as a 128-channel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography">EEG system</a> (<a href="http://www.brainproducts.com/productdetails.php?id=2">BrainAmp DC</a>, by <a href="http://www.brainproducts.com/">BrainProducts</a>, Germany). The lab is also affiliated with the <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/nellab/">Neuroscience of Language Lab</a>, which houses a state-of-the-art 208-channel whole-head <a href="http://megcommunity.org/what-is-meg">MEG system</a> (by the <a href="http://www.kanazawa-it.ac.jp/ekit/about/laboratories.html">Kanazawa Institute of Technology</a>, Japan), allowing for unimodal MEG recordings as well as concurrent EEG-MEG recordings with up to 64 EEG channels. In addition, a state-of-the-art fMRI facility is currently under construction in the <a href="http://nyuad.nyu.edu/about/locations/saadiyat-island-campus.html">new NYU-AD campus in Saadiyat Island</a>, which will expand the repertoire of brain imaging research that can be carried out in the lab.
